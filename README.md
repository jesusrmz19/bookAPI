# Book API

This is a personal RESTful API that will let me add, delete, and update the books I've read in 2021.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The initial challenge is to create a RESTful API using by learning and using new technologies like Node.js, Express, JWT, among others.

The API won't be open to anyone as I will be the only one capable of adding new content or update the current one.

## Process

### Built with

- Node.js
- Express
- JWT
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS

## Example

So far the data returned looks like this

```json
{
  "_id": "616779daf636c89be955bfc4",
  "title": "Gather Together in My Name",
  "author": "Maya Angelou",
  "pages": 224,
  "__v": 0
}
```
